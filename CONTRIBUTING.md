#Agreements on Pull Request Workflow:

This workflow is required for the Group project.

**Make sure to set your git user and email so you get credit for your work**

    1. Create a branch named for the feature you are working on
    2. Write Code
    3. Commit your code and write a good commit message
    4. Push your branch and changes to your Github repository
    5. Create a Pull Request to your cohort organization


#Agreements on Code Review Workflow:

    1. Another team mate reviews the pull request and writes code comments on Github
    2. You make the desired changes (using the Pull Request Workflow)
    3. Repeat #1-2 until teammate has no more changes that need to be made

**Team should choose who merges Pull requests: code writer or the reviewer.**
